Once upon a time, in the magical world of Madtown there lived a quiet and peaceful group of stneduts, but everything changed when the Suriv attacked. In a land once filled 
  with glee and jubilation, now condemned to a wasteland, a shell of its former self. The Suriv was dangerous not only because it affected the lifestyle of the stneduts, but
  because it was a parasitic species, tying itself to the stnedets' bodies and breeding within them. The stneduts who so desperately wanted to return to their previous 
  lifestyle were the exact ones who prolonged the infestation, carrying the Suriv back to their dens to multiply.
  
At this place, we see infected rats being cruel, humanity being devastated by a virus, an uncontrolled, broken lawnmower, drives children crazy from the heartland, 
  a smoker who will try to stop everything, a reclusive alcoholic who begins a gruesome transformation, and many more shadows and visions show up. When two young men 
  venture into the woods, and only one returns alive, their friends begin to realize that their city is filled with forces of darkness far beyond their imagination.
